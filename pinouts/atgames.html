1. The MCU

   A1 |            | ???
  SEL |            | ???
START |9_________18| ???
  
The current MCU used is unknown. But it's assumed
most of the pins on the right side of the chip are
GND as they don't seem to (from a surface examination)
have traces going to them

The MCU's job is to take the input from the joystick
and convert it to data to be sent out through the IR
blaster that gets sent to the main console
