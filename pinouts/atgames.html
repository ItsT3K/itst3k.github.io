	The MCU currently is unknown, But it is assumed to be a Microchip PIC16F87/88 MCU
due to the similarities in form factor and pin layout.

	SEL |            | ???
      START |9_________10| ???
  
 The form factor of the chip is a 18-pin PDIP SOIC. So what do these pins match 
with the PIC16F87/88.

	=======================================================
	| RA/RB	| The RA/RB pins are Bidirectional I/O pins.  |
	|	| RA5 however is a Input pin.                 |

	The IR Blaster layout is pretty simple, The output to the IR blaster comes from
RA2 (TX?) and goes through a 102 Ohm resistor to a GS8050M NPN Transistor. It then
goes through a 100 Ohm Resistor then out to the IR Blaster

===================================
	At some point I plan on grabbing a device to analyze the IR output to see how the
controller communicates to the console. That concludes this document for now.
