    <p><i>A project awaiting completion</i></p>

    <p>A While back I found the original <a href="https://github.com/topherPedersen/OregonTrail1978">Game's BASIC Source</a> on
        github and decided. <i>"hey... If this is BASIC... Why not the C64??"</i> So I started off on porting the game over to
        C64 BASIC V2. The game currently is unfinished but the source can be downloaded on my GitHub page and my GitLab page.

    <p>Sorry for the pretty boring page on it. Just wanted to tell how it came to be.</p>
